Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) is an important technique in the domain of automated planning. However, the heuristic strategies for HTN planning have not been much investigated.

In this report, we have proposed our Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning heuristic strategies, which help to accelerate the automated planning process, and also guarantee to find the best solution. The HTN planning algorithm on which the heuristics are based is also discussed.
