\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chapter5}
In this work, we have proposed a sound and complete abstract HTN planning procedure, and based on this procedure, we have proposed the heuristics which help to find the best solution quickly. The heuristics work on two choices of a HTN planning algorithm, they are based on A* algorithm and minimum distance estimation algorithm respectively. For the implementation, we have discussed our work on HTN planning algorithm, which introduces the interest to be distributed to support multiagents planning.

For the future work, we will finish the implementation of the HTN algorithm, and evaluate the heuristics we proposed. Other heuristics which suit for HTN planning are possible, we may make comparison with the heuristics in this report. If possible, we will distribute the planning process of our HTN planning algorithm, and extend the system to be a multiagents HTN planning system.
